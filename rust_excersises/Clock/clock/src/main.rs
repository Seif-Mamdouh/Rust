// Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

// You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

// Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.



// struct Clock {
//     hours: i32,
//     minutes: i32,
// }

// fn clock() 

// fn main() {
//     println!("Hello, world!");
// }

// Write a Rust program that accepts two numbers from the user, adds them together, and displays the result.


// Write a Rust program that declares a mutable variable counter and initializes it with 0. 
// Then increase it by 1 and decrease it by 1. At the end, print the variable value for each stage.
